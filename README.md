# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

Maria was asked by the school board to put together an analysis of the school district to help make future funding decisions. This included an analysis of any trends by grade level, budget spent, school size, and school type across all of the schools in the district. Maria enlisted our help to perform this initial analysis for the district, but then a suspected case of academic dishonesty came up in one of the school's 9th grade classes. Because of this, we had to revisit our analysis and account for the student's whose scores were invalidated.

## Results

### District Summary

Overall, the district summary did not see much of an impact with the removal of the 9th grade class from Thomas High School's student's grades from the analysis.
